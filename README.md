# BYOL Pretraining and Downstream Classification

This repository contains the implementation of **Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL)** for self-supervised learning, followed by fine-tuning on a downstream classification task. The downstream task involves classifying COVID-19 CT scan images into **COVID** or **non-COVID** categories.

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to use **BYOL** for self-supervised representation learning on an image dataset and then fine-tune the learned representations for a specific downstream task, such as **COVID-19 classification** using CT scan images. 

The repository is split into two main phases:
1. **BYOL Pretraining**: A self-supervised model is trained using BYOL.
2. **Downstream Classification**: The pretrained model is fine-tuned for binary classification of CT scans (COVID-19 vs. non-COVID-19).
